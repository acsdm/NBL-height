# NBL-height
This repository contains the R scripts utilized to generate all figures presented in the manuscript titled "Estimation through direct turbulence measurements of the Nocturnal Boundary Layer Height over the Central Amazon Forest."

# Included Files:

1) SonicTermH.R:
This script generates Figures 1b-g, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 using the data file "data_sonic_termh_2022.csv". 

2) Roughness.R: 
This script generates Figure 1a utilizing the data file "log_wind_profile.csv". 

The scripts were created by Anne Mendon√ßa with the support of Dr. Luca Mortarini. Detailed comments are included to guide users through the code.

# Notes
- Analyses were conducted using the R Statistical language version 4.3.3 (R Core Team, 2024) on Windows 11 x 64 (build 22621).
- Figures were made with ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) version 3.5.0.
